        <h3>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

                    <h1>Our 4th Year of Love</h1>    
                    <p>How hard it is to believe that it's been 4 years. I wonder how many times I will say this in the future? I hope I get to say
                    it for the rest of my life. Anyway here we are four years later, we've been through a lot both good and bad. We've grown together and it's such
                    a good feeling.</p>
                    <p>These past few years have flown by and yet when I'm with you time seems to slow down. As if it's giving me the full pleasure of being around
                    you, knowing that even if we don't have long that we can cherish the time we get to hold each other and talk. No matter what has happened
                    or what may happen in the future I don't see my feelings changing. You are the one for me, and that's a fact.</p>
                    <p>It sucks that I have no money and can't get you an actual gift for our anniversary, but all of this comes from my heart. Happy four years
                    hun, and I hope to have lots of happy years ahead of us. <'/love'> <<< Because webdesign jokes are hilarious.</p>

                <h4><u>Why do I love you, Amanda Kelly Banken?</u></h4>
                <p>For starters your smile is absolutely glowing. I feel like I'll go blind if I keep looking, but all jokes aside you do have the most
                beautiful smile. Not to mention your smile is highly contagious. At your heart you are a child, but when you need to be you are serious and
                mature. I just love how we can play around with each other and even when I make stupid jokes you still laugh.</p>
                <p>You have shown me a love I never thought would exist. I long for the days when I can look into those beautiful eyes of yours, and
                just laugh together. Did I mention how sweet you are? You are almost as corny as me sometimes, and I love it. There are so many things that
                I just love about you, and I don't have enough space on the internet to type all of my thoughts down, so I'll just end with this:</p>
                <h3>I LOVE YOU!</h3>
